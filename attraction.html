	<h2>Beaches</h2>
	<p>
        Nicknamed the "sunshine state" for its year-round warm weather, Goa is 
        home to India's top beaches, fringed by palms and stretching for miles
        along the Arabian Sea. Each beach has its own vibe, from backpacker hangouts
        to wellness-focused yoga retreats.
        If you're looking for an upbeat scene, beaches like Anjuna, Baga, and Calangute offer
        water sports like surfing and parasailing, as well as live music on the sands after sunset.
        You can unwind or keep the party going at beach shacks, where bars serve ice-cold beer and
        restaurants dish up seafood like prawn tempura and tuna tartare.

	<h2>Night Life</h2>
	<p>
        Goa's buzzing nightlife is a throwback to the 1960s, when beaches like Anjuna became
        famous for their full-moon raves. The scene is more organized these days, but crowds 
        still hang out at trendy beach shacks where DJs spin house and trance till sunrise.
        North Goa is the main party zone, with a string of lively clubs and bars overlooking Baga and 
        Calangute beaches. For a more laid-back vibe, you'll find old-school taverns both beachside
        and in the state capital Panaji, where you can sip feni, a strong local liquor distilled from cashew nuts.

<h2>Adventure Sports</h2>
<p>
    With its coastline, rivers, and inland forests, Goa is a hot spot for adventure sports
    ranging from waterfall trekking to all-terrain biking. Lots of activities are aimed at 
    backpackers, while options like parasailing and ballooning are also popular with families.
    Windsurfers and kitesurfers can catch stiff breezes at beaches like Morjim and Arambol, with 
    lighter winds at Dona Paula Beach ideal for beginners. Groups of friends can skim the waves on 
    banana boat rides, or down the Mandovi River on a whitewater rafting trip. For adrenaline junkies, 
    there's a bungee jump platform at Mayem Lake.
